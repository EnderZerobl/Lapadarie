# Creators

<p>This work was developed by me and my colleague <a href="https://github.com/Prianjss" style="text-decoration: none">Priscila Anjos</a>. In this work, I did the Backend part and she did the Frontend part.</p>

# Tecnologies 

<p>We use in the backend, the express and prisma technologies, having SQlite as a database, in this fragment of the work. On the frontend, Nextjs, a React framework, was used. As for the main language, Typescript was used both in the Frontend and in the Backend.</p>
<p>It is worth considering that we use axios, which is a promise-based HTTP Client, for the integration between the parts of the work</p>
